## Manifesto

In broad terms, this school will be:

### Holistic -

With a carefully constructed educational experience to develop technical skills, cross-cutting skills, and leadership (a knowledge of self coupled with an ability to develop others).

### Reconnect humans with themselves -

Not just move to the countryside. It's also reconnecting with what makes us humans. Walking barefoot in grass, being surrounded with nature makes us happier, more productive, reduces stress and as a result improves learning.

### Rigorous -

Countryside doesn't mean we're here to take it easy. On the contrary we want to set very high standard for ourselves, and we expect the same from students. It's also the best way to inspire them and help them push their limits.

### A boarding school -

What better way to develop a sense of togetherness and social awareness than to actually live together? Connecting with new people & socializing are skills than make us better humans. Struggling together makes us more resilient, less prone to give up and also creates strong bonds with like-minded people.

### Financially accessible to all -

Any motivated person who adheres to the values of the school should be able to join. By offering training, room and board, we want to optimize the costs to have a total cost accessible even to a person on social welfare.

### An educational experimentation lab -

Having a scientific approach and measuring the effects of what we do is essential if we want a system that improves over time. Experiment, measure, learn, share! We believe there is ALWAYS room for improvement.

### Open source -

We don't yet know what legal status the school will have, but the ambition is to have a transparent and open source operation. Our feedback will be public, so that others can be inspired freely. That's also why we want to document the reflections and the research upstream of the school!
