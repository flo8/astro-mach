## Manifesto

In broad terms, this school will be:

### An ecosystem

With a carefully constructed educational experience to develop technical skills, cross-cutting skills, and leadership (a knowledge of self coupled with an ability to develop others).

### Rigorous

Fun and enjoyable doesn't mean we're here to take it easy. We want to set very high standard for ourselves, and we expect the same from students. It's also the best way to inspire them and help them push their limits.

### Financially accessible to all

Any motivated person who adheres to our code of conduct should be able to join. Our model is designed to optimize the costs while keeping a great learning experience so even a person on social welfare can apply.

### An educational experimentation lab

Having a scientific approach and measuring the effects of what we do is essential if we want a system that improves over time. Experiment, measure, learn, share! We believe there is ALWAYS room for improvement.

### 100% open source

We don't yet know what legal status this project will have, but the ambition is to have a transparent and open source operation. Our progress will be public, so that others can be inspired freely.
That's also why we want to document the reflections and the research upstream of the school!
